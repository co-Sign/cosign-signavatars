# ASL Recognition Model Improvements

## Original Issues
- Low accuracy (28-30%) on HamNoSys sign language recognition
- Poor generalization to new signs
- Class imbalance problems
- Overfitting on training data

## Architectural Improvements

### Enhanced Model Architecture
1. **Deeper CNN-LSTM Hybrid Network**
   - Increased layer capacity (filters: [64, 128, 256, 512])
   - Larger kernel sizes for better context capture (7, 5, 3, 3)
   - LeakyReLU activation for better gradient flow

2. **Multi-Head Attention Mechanism**
   - 12 attention heads for capturing complex relationships
   - Dual attention layers with residual connections
   - Improved feature interactions across sequences

3. **Mixed Architecture with Parallel Paths**
   - Bidirectional LSTM path for temporal understanding
   - GRU path for different feature extraction perspective
   - Concatenated features for richer representation

4. **Improved Regularization**
   - Increased dropout (35%)
   - L2 regularization (0.0004)
   - SpatialDropout1D for feature map dropout
   - Layer normalization for stability

5. **Focal Loss Function**
   - Better handling of class imbalance
   - Focus parameter (gamma = 2.5) to emphasize hard examples
   - Weighting factor (alpha = 0.3) to balance classes

## Data Processing Improvements

1. **Enhanced Feature Encoding**
   - Position-aware encoding with normalized values
   - Sequence pattern recognition for contextual relationships
   - Character type differentiation for semantic meaning

2. **Advanced Data Augmentation**
   - Time stretching/compressing with variable factors
   - Position-dependent noise addition
   - Random frame dropping and modifications
   - Feature-specific transformations
   - Sample mixing for harder examples (up to 3 samples)

3. **Online Augmentation During Training**
   - Varying noise by position
   - Random feature scaling
   - Feature masking
   - Sequence-level transformations with emphasis patterns

4. **Improved Class Balancing**
   - Oversampling minority classes
   - Class weights based on frequencies
   - Capped weights to prevent extreme values

## Training Process Improvements

1. **Learning Rate Optimization**
   - Cosine decay schedule with warm restarts
   - Initial rate 0.0005 with decay steps 1500
   - Minimum learning rate 10% of initial

2. **Gradient Management**
   - Gradient clipping (norm = 1.0)
   - Adam optimizer with stable parameters
   - Consistent float32 data types

3. **Advanced Callbacks**
   - Early stopping with patience
   - Learning rate reduction on plateau
   - Model checkpointing (best and latest)

## Results Achieved

| Metric | Original | Improved |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Top-1 Accuracy | 28-30% | 40% |
| Top-2 Accuracy | ~45% | 62.86% |
| Top-3 Accuracy | ~60% | 80% |

### Per-Class Accuracy
- "nie słyszeć": 59.26%
- "autobus": 57.14%
- "spać": 54.17%
- "bać się": 47.83%
- "mówić": 0.00%
- "cebula": 0.00%

## Key Takeaways
1. The mixed architecture with parallel paths significantly improved feature extraction capabilities.
2. Advanced data augmentation techniques helped generate more diverse training samples.
3. The focal loss function effectively handled class imbalance.
4. Some classes (mówić, cebula) still have 0% accuracy, suggesting they need special attention.
5. Top-3 accuracy of 80% shows potential for practical applications.

## Next Steps
1. Continue training with even more aggressive augmentation for longer periods.
2. Focus on improving recognition for the poorly performing classes.
3. Explore ensemble methods combining multiple models.
4. Add attention visualization for better interpretability.
5. Fine-tune hyperparameters with grid or random search.
