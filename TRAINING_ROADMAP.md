# Enhanced HamNoSys Recognition Training Roadmap

This document outlines the updated training roadmap and planned improvements for the HamNoSys sign language recognition system.

## Current Status

- **Top-1 Accuracy**: ~60-70%
- **Top-2 Accuracy**: ~80-85%
- **Top-3 Accuracy**: ~90%
- **Target Accuracy**: >95%

The model shows significant improvement with our enhanced architecture but requires further refinement to reach production-quality accuracy.
