# HamNoSys Recognition Training Roadmap

This document outlines the training roadmap and planned improvements for the HamNoSys sign language recognition system.

## Current Status

- **Top-1 Accuracy**: ~31%
- **Top-2 Accuracy**: ~60%
- **Top-3 Accuracy**: ~74%

The model shows promising results on recognizing sign language from HamNoSys notations, but needs further improvements to reach production-quality accuracy.

## Automated Training System

We've implemented an automated training system that:
1. Handles continuous training with automatic restart
2. Processes data in smaller batches to avoid CPU overload
3. Maintains only two consolidated models (best and latest)
4. Progresses to inference when accuracy threshold is met
5. Provides comprehensive logging and visualization

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Multi-Dataset Integration (Priority: HIGH)

- [x] Add support for WLASL dataset
- [x] Add support for Phoenix dataset
- [x] Add support for How2Sign dataset
- [ ] Integrate all datasets with proper weighting
- [ ] Implement cross-dataset validation

### 2. Model Architecture Improvements (Priority: HIGH)

- [ ] Experiment with deeper attention layers
- [ ] Try different embedding dimensions (128, 256, 512)
- [ ] Implement transformer-based architecture variants
- [ ] Test with bidirectional LSTM layers
- [ ] Implement ensemble methods combining multiple models

### 3. Training Optimizations (Priority: MEDIUM)

- [ ] Implement learning rate scheduling strategies
- [ ] Test different optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, SGD with momentum)
- [ ] Try gradient accumulation for larger effective batch sizes
- [ ] Implement mixed-precision training to speed up processing
- [ ] Test different early stopping criteria

### 4. Data Augmentation Improvements (Priority: HIGH)

- [ ] Implement more advanced augmentation techniques
- [ ] Generate synthetic HamNoSys sequences
- [ ] Apply contextual augmentation based on sign language rules
- [ ] Implement sequence perturbation techniques

### 5. Evaluation and Metrics (Priority: MEDIUM)

- [ ] Add more detailed per-class metrics
- [ ] Implement confusion matrix visualization
- [ ] Add error analysis tools for misclassified examples
- [ ] Implement cross-validation across data batches

## Long-Term Goals

### 1. Multi-Modal Integration

- [ ] Integrate video inputs alongside HamNoSys notations
- [ ] Add support for skeleton-based inputs (from motion capture)
- [ ] Create joint embeddings across notation systems

### 2. Real-Time Applications

- [ ] Optimize model for real-time inference
- [ ] Create API for integration with other systems
- [ ] Develop mobile-friendly model variants

### 3. Extended Language Support

- [ ] Add support for more sign languages
- [ ] Implement cross-language transfer learning
- [ ] Create language-agnostic embeddings

## Performance Targets

| Milestone | Top-1 Accuracy | Target Date |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Alpha     | 50%            | Immediate   |
| Beta      | 75%            | Short-term  |
| v1.0      | 90%            | Mid-term    |
| v2.0      | 95%            | Long-term   |

## Monitoring and Evaluation

We'll track progress through:
1. Automated logging system
2. Regular evaluation against test sets
3. Periodic model comparison across training runs
